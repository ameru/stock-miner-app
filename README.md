playing around with JQuery, JFrame, Regex, and SQLite!

3. Make sure the database is in the SQLite format (or else my program probably won't run, sorry)

4. Select the stock you'd like to view, and click "Update" to get new prices.

I only added a couple stock prices (sourced from money.CNN) but you can always change/add more stocks by adjusting the query number at the end through the source code. Happy scraping!
